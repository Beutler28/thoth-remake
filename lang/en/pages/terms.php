In order to use the application, identify authors and project participants, and authors of reviews and decisions on publications, the application collects and stores the user\'s Name and Email Address, associating them with the necessary records through a numerical Identifier. A password is required for authentication in the system and is stored in encrypted form. Thus, a possible data leak will not expose the real passwords of the users. Anyway, we recommend that you do not use a password already used in another service so that, in a future possibility of encryption breakage, the user does not have this other service compromised. Your name and records produced in the system (reviews and decisions, for example) may be present in files exported by other project owners. In this case, the privacy of this data will be the responsibility of the project owner user and by using the system and participating in a project you accept the transfer of this data. Observing the LGPD, the user may request the deletion of their personal data, as well as any record produced by them from the application database. This deletion does not extend to backup copies exported by other users as it is technically unfeasible.',
